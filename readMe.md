Complete Solution Overview
The solution consists of three main components:

Data Collection (MLBAnalyzer class)

Retrieves player game logs and statistics for multiple teams
Organizes data by player, team, and game type (hitting or pitching)
Saves data to CSV files for further analysis


Analysis Model (MLBModelAnalysis class)

Identifies "hot" batters using weighted recent performance metrics
Evaluates pitcher effectiveness using ERA, WHIP, K/9, and other metrics
Predicts upcoming interesting matchups based on player performance


Visualization (MLBVisualizer class)

Creates interactive Plotly visualizations for hot batters
Shows pitcher performance trends and effectiveness
Visualizes upcoming matchups with interest scores
Provides individual player and team performance trends



How It Works

Finding Hot Batters

Collects the last 10 games for each player
Calculates key batting metrics (AVG, OPS, SLG)
Applies recency weighting to prioritize recent performance
Creates a "hotness score" based on multiple weighted metrics
Ranks batters by this composite score


Identifying Effective Pitchers

Analyzes recent game logs for all pitchers
Normalizes ERA, WHIP, K/9, and BB/9 rates
Creates an "effectiveness score" that balances these metrics
Considers sample size (innings pitched, games played)


Matchup Prediction

Retrieves upcoming game schedules for all teams
Identifies games featuring hot batters facing effective pitchers
Assigns "interest scores" based on player performance metrics
Ranks matchups by potential interest/importance



Key Features

Weighted recency: Recent performance is weighted more heavily
Composite metrics: Multiple statistics combined for better evaluation
Interactive visualizations: HTML-based Plotly graphs for exploring data
Team-level analysis: Aggregate performance statistics by team
Individual player trends: Track performance changes over time
CSV data export: Save organized data for external analysis

Usage and Implementation
The runner script ties everything together in a straightforward workflow:

Initialize the analyzer and collect data for selected teams
Run the analysis to identify hot batters and effective pitchers
Predict interesting upcoming matchups
Generate visualizations for batters, pitchers, matchups, and trends
Save all data and visualizations to files
